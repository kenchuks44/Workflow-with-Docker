# Workflow-with-Docker

## This project demonstrates how Docker containers are used in the development and deployment process to create a consistent and portable environment for building, testing and running applications. Specifically, we will use a Java Maven application. Firstly, we will push the application code to a remote repository, then connect Jenkins to the repository. Jenkins builds the application as well as a Docker image which will now be pushed to a Docker repository (DockerHub)
