# Workflow-with-Docker

## This project demonstrates how Docker containers are used in the development and deployment process to create a consistent and portable environment for building, testing and running applications. Specifically, we will use a Java Maven application. Firstly, we will push the application code to a remote repository, then connect Jenkins to the repository. Jenkins builds the application as well as a Docker image which will now be pushed to a Docker repository (DockerHub)

## Step 1: Installing Jenkins 
Here, we will run Jenkins as a Docker container 
-	Create a Jenkins server/VM/EC2 Instance/Digital Ocean Droplet
-	Open port 22 for SSH
-	Add custom port (8080) to expose Jenkins application
-	SSH into the server and run the commands below:
```
apt update
apt install docker.io
docker run –p8080:8080 –p50000:50000 –d –v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

## Step 2: 
After running Jenkins as a Docker container, we authenticate Jenkins using the Initial Admin Password. To do this, we go into the container where Jenkins runs and execute the commands below
```
docker ps 
docker exec –it <container_ID> bash
cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Then, in the browser, using the Jenkins server IP and the port to load the Jenkins UI, install suggested plugins and create your first admin user

## Step 3:Install Build tools in Jenkins 
Here, as we have a Java Maven Application, we will install maven plugin. Other required plugins like Github plugin already got installed when we installed recommended plugins during Jenkins initialization.

Next, we create a new free-style job called java-maven-build. Next, we configure the java-maven-build. Under Global configuration, we add Maven plugin that had been installed.

## Step 4: Connect Jenkins to Git repository 
Firstly, we create a PAT under Developer Settings in GitHub and add the credentials to  Jenkins

Under Configuration, input the GitHub credentials that was created, specify the repository URL and the branch to build

## Step 5: Building Docker image and pushing to DockerHub 
To build docker image of our application, we need to have docker commands available in Jenkins by attaching a volume to Jenkins from the host file. This entails mounting docker directory from the server into the container as a volume. To set this up, run the commands below. The commands re-attaches persistent volume to new container.
```
docker stop <container_ID>
docker run –p8080:8080 –p50000:50000 –d \
-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v $(which docker) : /usr/bin/docker jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

Then, we reconfigure permission for /var/run/docker.sock file to enable docker commands to now be executed inside the container by running the commands below
```
docker exec –u 0 –it <container_ID> bash
chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```
## Step 6: Pushing image to DockerHub
We will first create a DockerHub account, add the dockerhub credentials in Jenkins. In the java-maven-app configuration in Jenkins, under build steps, we invoke the top-level maven target and then input the commands below into the execute shell window. Also, under java-maven-build configuration, we configure the build environment using the dockerhub credentials created. Finally, we build the application.

```
docker build –t <dockerhub_username>/<dockerhub_repo>:jma-1.0
echo $PASSWORD | docker login –u $USERNAME --password-stdin
docker push <dockerhub_username>/<dockerhub_repo>:jma-1.0
```
